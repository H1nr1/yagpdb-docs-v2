## YouTube Feed

Fill in either the YouTube Channel ID, or a Channel URL, not both. The bot will automatically extract the Channel ID
from the URL.

If your channel looks like this `youtube.com/user/h3h3Productions` then you would go into the username line and type
in h3h3Productions.

If your channel looks like this `youtube.com/channel/UCt-ERbX-2yA6cAqfdKOlUwQ` then you would go into the ID line and
type in UCt-ERbX-2yA6cAqfdKOlUwQ.

There may be up to 5--15 minutes of delay for the bot to announce the video after it gets posted, if and only if it is
publicly available. Should you publish your videos as "Members first", the bot will post an announcement once it is
available to the public.

You can change the channel that the notifications are posted to via the dropdown menu.

You can also mention everyone by clicking the checkbox under the dropdown menu that says Mention everyone.
